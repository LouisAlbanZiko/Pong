# Pong

If you only want to play the game download the Pong.jar file and the script for your operating system:

- windows -> pong-windows.bat
- linux -> pong-linux.sh  (needs to be marked as a runnable file; ie run command `chmod +x pong-linux.sh` in the directory containing the file)
- mac -> I don't know how scripts work for mac but basically you need to copy the command from the linux file and put it in your own script

Project has eclipse files and lwjgl files. If you want to look at/modify the code, copy the repository into your eclipse workspace and create a java project with the name 'Pong' and the project will be setup.
